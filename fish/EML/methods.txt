"Sampling design for this project consisted of establishing permanent sampling reaches for each park unit, then collecting fish community data and associated habitat data at each reach.  The field data collection consisted of (1) collecting initial water quality data, (2) sampling fish within the reach and then processing fish samples, (3) collecting habitat data, (4) collecting water discharge data and (5) collecting final measures of water quality. Fish were sampled either using electrofish methods for large rivers, springs and streams or electrofish and seine methods for small prairie streams. Water quality and site condition measures included weather conditions, water temperature, and CORE 5 water quality measures (pH, specific conductance, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and water turbidity). Habitat measures were taken using point-transect method and included measures of channel morphology, fish cover, and bank conditions. Water discharge measures were taken both by direct measures in the field at the reach site and from nearby hydrologic gauge stations.
