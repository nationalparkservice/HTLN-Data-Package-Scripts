The Heartland Inventory and Monitoring Network monitors the Missouri bladderpod (Physaria filiformis, formerly Lesquerella filiformis) a federally threatened plant at Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield. The plant is surveyed annually in the spring with the objectives to track changes in the abundance, distribution, and persistence of the Missouri bladderpod through time at Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield. Values for photosynthetically active radiation and Eastern red cedar basal area are also collected to see how that may play a role in plant density amounts over time.
