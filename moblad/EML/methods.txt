Beginning the first week in April of each year, the Missouri bladderpod population at grid A is inspected twice weekly to note the phenological status of the plants. Flowering typically begins in early to mid-April. Once peak flowering is observed, monitoring surveys begin. At grid A and C, observers mark the corners of 5 m X 5 m cells. During most years at grid A, only cells in the core area are sampled. Every five years, however, the entire grid is sampled. At the other eight grids, observers navigate in 15 m × 15 m (225 m^2) cells using a GNSS (global navigation satellite system) device; corners are not marked. For all sites, Missouri bladderpod density is estimated in grid cells using a density class scale: 0 = no plants, 1 = 1-9 plants, 2 = 10-49 plants, 3 = 50-99 plants, 4 = 100-499 plants, 5 = 500-999 plants, 6 = 1,000-4,999 plants, and 7 = >5,000 plants.
Prior to estimating density, observers calibrate their estimates. Observers estimate abundance using the density class scale (0 = no plants, 1 = 1-9 plants, 2 = 10-49 plants, 3 = 50-99 plants, 4 = 100-499 plants, 5 = 500-999 plants, 6 = 1,000-4,999 plants, 7 = >5,000 plants) and then count the plants in the plot at the ground-level. This process is performed over a range of plot densities until estimates match counts. Observers should also compare results until estimates begin to converge. When estimating density, observers should consider counting up to 100 bladderpods in a 5 × 5m plot before determining estimates. Observers have the discretion to count as many plants as needed to improve confidence in the density estimate. Such counting may encompass all plants in the cell or only the plants in certain section of the plot (e.g., a particularly dense cluster of plants). If needed, plants may be counted in a portion of the plot and then extrapolated to the 5 × 5 m plot. Accuracy Assessment for Density Class Estimation is done on grid A only. 
After estimating density for each 5 × 5 m plot at grid A, 60 cells are randomly selected using the rand() function in Excel. Each plot is visited to assess reliability of density class assignments. Additional cells of known density class are selected subjectively for accuracy assessment to bring the total number of cells assessed per density class to 10.
Habitat measurement only takes place on grid A. The percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is measured at each plot center using LI-190 Quantum Sensors. PAR is the part of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum (400-700 nm) used in photosynthesis. Field workers also measure the diameter at breast height 
(dbh) of all Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) stems reaching breast height (1.37 m). Because cedar basal area will not vary greatly in the absence of disturbance, such measurements are only required on a five-year basis. Observers should, however, measure cedar basal area following significant canopy changes (e.g., thinning, fire, ice storms, tornados).
