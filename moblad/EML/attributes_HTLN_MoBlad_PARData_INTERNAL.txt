PAR_CanopyInMicroMolePerMeterSquaredPerSecond	Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reading under canopy, averaged over 15 sec (simultaneous with PAR in full sun reading using LI-250A Light Meter and LI-190 Quantum Sensor). This is the non-control part of the ratio. Measurement taken at same time as full sun value, but at grid location. PAR_Canopy divided by PAR_FullSun will give you the percent of full sun at the grid cell.	numeric	micromolePerMeterSquaredPerSecond			
PAR_FullSunInMicroMolePerMeterSquaredPerSecond	Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reading in full sun, averaged over 15 sec (simultaneous with PAR under canopy reading using LI-250A Light Meter and LI-190 Quantum Sensor). This is the control part of the ratio. Measurement taken at same time as canopy value, but away from grid in full openness/full sunlight. PAR_Canopy divided by PAR_FullSun will give you the percent of full sun at the grid cell.	numeric	micromolePerMeterSquaredPerSecond
