Geographic coverage (Required) - Geographic coverage will be dropped from the EML until these issues are fixed:
1.  Missing geographic coverage metadata. Geographic coverage describes the locations and areas where these data were collected.

Personnel (Required) - Personnel (creators, contacts, etc.) will be dropped from the EML until these issues are fixed:

1.  Missing units. Attributes with a numeric class require units. These attributes have missing units: InRiparianCorridor
2.  Undefined units. Units must be from the EML standard unit dictionary or defined as custom units. The units of these attributes are undefined: Slope, Aspect

Data table attributes (PlotPhysicalFeatures.csv, Optional):
1.  Inaccurate classes. These attributes are classified as 'numeric' but in the data contain character strings other than those listed as missing value codes in the data and will therefore be reclassified as 'character': Slope, Aspect
