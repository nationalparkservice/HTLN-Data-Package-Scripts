We designed the park reference frames (i.e., the area to be monitored) to focus on accessible natural and restored areas. The field methods vary for small parks and large parks, defined as parks with reference frames less than and greater than 350 acres (142 ha), respectively. For small parks, surveyors make three equidistant passes through polygon search units that are approximately 2-acres (0.8 ha) in size. For large parks, surveyors record each ProP encountered along 200-m or 400-m line search units. The cover of each ProP taxa encountered in search units is estimated using the following cover scale: 0 = 0, 1 = 0.1-0.9 m2, 2 = 1-9.9 m2, 3 = 10-49.9 m2, 4 = 50-99.9 m2, 5 = 100-499.9 m2, 6 = 499.9-999.9 m2, and 7 = 1,000- 4,999.9 m2. The field data are managed in the FieldDB database. Monitoring is scheduled to revisit most parks every four years.
